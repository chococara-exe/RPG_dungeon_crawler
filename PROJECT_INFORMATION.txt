Programming language used: Python
Purpose of code: to play a dungeon crawler game with a combat, inventory and dialogue system
Scale of project: number of classes = 20, lines of code = 1242
Use of OOP concepts:
- abstraction (Game)
- inheritance (eg. Player is a child of Entity)
- composition (eg. Player has an Inventory)
- aggregation (eg. Level might have Enemies)
- encapsulation (class attributes are only accessible within the class or by class methods)
Interesting use of data structures:
- a tree is created for the dialogue options
- dictionaries are used to store entity data
